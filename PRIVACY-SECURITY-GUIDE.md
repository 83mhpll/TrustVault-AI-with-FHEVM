# 🔒 TrustVault AI Privacy & Security Guide

> **Why TrustVault AI is the Most Secure Platform for AI Model Rating**

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security Overview

TrustVault AI is built with **privacy-first principles** using cutting-edge **FHEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption)**
technology. Unlike traditional platforms, we **cannot and will not** access your private information, making us the most
secure choice for AI model evaluation.

## 🚫 What We CANNOT See

### **Your Private Information is Completely Protected**

- ❌ **Seed Phrase** - Your 12-24 word recovery phrase
- ❌ **Private Key** - Your wallet's private cryptographic key
- ❌ **Password** - Your wallet password or PIN
- ❌ **Personal Data** - Any personal information you don't explicitly share
- ❌ **Individual Ratings** - Your specific ratings are encrypted and never revealed
- ❌ **Wallet Contents** - What's inside your wallet beyond public addresses

### **Why This Matters**

Traditional platforms can:

- 🚨 **Access your data** without your knowledge
- 🚨 **Sell your information** to third parties
- 🚨 **Track your behavior** across the platform
- 🚨 **Compromise your privacy** for profit

**TrustVault AI cannot do any of these things** - it's technically impossible with our architecture.

## ✅ What We CAN See (Public Information Only)

### **Only Public Blockchain Data**

- ✅ **Public Address** - Your wallet's public address (like a bank account number)
- ✅ **Transaction History** - Public transactions on the blockchain
- ✅ **Aggregated Statistics** - Combined, anonymous rating data
- ✅ **Contract Events** - Public smart contract interactions

### **This is Like Public Information**

Think of it like:

- 🏦 **Bank Account Number** - Public, but not your PIN
- 📧 **Email Address** - Public, but not your password
- 🏠 **House Address** - Public, but not what's inside
- 📊 **Public Statistics** - Aggregated data, not individual details

## 🔐 How FHEVM Protects You

### **Fully Homomorphic Encryption**

```typescript
// Your rating is encrypted BEFORE leaving your device
const encryptedRating = await fhevm.encrypt(yourRating);

// We can process encrypted data without seeing it
const result = await processEncryptedData(encryptedRating);

// Only YOU can decrypt the final result
const finalResult = await fhevm.decrypt(result);
```

### **Zero-Knowledge Processing**

1. **Encrypt Locally** - Your data is encrypted on your device
2. **Process Encrypted** - We process without seeing the content
3. **Return Encrypted** - Results are encrypted back to you
4. **Decrypt Locally** - Only you can see the final results
